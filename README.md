﻿# BetterPasswords - About

The BetterPasswords project was launched on the 24th of February 2017 and is aimed to increase the security of passwords.
With the recent trends in database leaks it is now more important than ever to use a strong and safe password to secure your accounts.
With database leaks there will be hashed (one-way encrypted) passwords which will be cracked using open-source software such as Hashcat.
We recommend you use a word you'll remember as your base password when using our software and we will then increase the security.
Our passwords are close to impossible to crack but are generally easy to remember.
Base words must be no shorter than 6 letters long!
Our goal is to make this project open-source and available in the widest variety of languages possible; contributions are appreciated!
